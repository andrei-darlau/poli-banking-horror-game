# Poli Banking Horror Game

## Description

You are a student at the Politehnica University of Bucharest and you want to reach the AN034 amphitheater while a
Politehnica Unemployment Fest is taking place. If an uemployment fest is taking place, it means that the Rectorat is
swarmed with banking agents from ING, BCR, BRD, Raiffeisen, etc trying to convince you to open a bank account with them.
You must reach AN034 to attend your class, but you must avoid the banking agents. If you get caught by a banking agent,
you will be forced to open a bank account and you will lose the game. If you reach AN034, you will win the game.
